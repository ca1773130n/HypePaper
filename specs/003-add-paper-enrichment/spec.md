# Feature Specification: Paper Enrichment Feature Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-paper-enrichment`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Clarified - Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "add paper enrichment feature improvement.
- fix the problem of incorrect paper published date issue. it's still showing the crawling date instead of actual publish date of the paper.
- detect the website url in abstract and add hyperlink when showing abstract. also, remember you should recognize project url or github url by its address and the sentence.
- add vote feature for the papers. prepare integer value in the paper metric as well as in the database. add up/down vote button in paper details page. show hype score and vote score in metric block in paper detail page. so there would be four metric to be shown.
- add vote value when calculating hype score. vote value could be zero or even minus. but usually it would be zero or positive integer.
- paper detail page is too boring. add affiliation info. add quick summary, key idea and quantitive and qualifitive performance, limitations block. add attributes for these blocks in papers database. we will implement how to fill these blocks later.
- there is authors table in supabase which is not used. i want to have rows for each author. an author row would have columns like name, affiliation, total citation number, latest paper reference id to the apper row in papers table, total number of paper as author for papers in our database, email address and personal website url.
- show the author information when clicked in paper details page or even in main page's paper list where there is also author list.
- the quick actions in the paper details page is too simple. add start crawling from this paper button where user will be at new crawler page with citation network type, auto filled the paper id. then user can configure other options and can launch the crawler.
- add graphs for tracked metrics. for each metric, add graph in time-series. (daily basis)"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a researcher browsing papers in HypePaper, I want to see accurate publication dates, rich author information, and be able to vote on papers to help the community identify valuable research. I also want to easily understand paper contributions through quick summaries and track how papers gain popularity over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Viewing Accurate Paper Information
1. **Given** a paper was crawled on 2025-10-10 but published on 2025-09-15
   **When** user views the paper in the list or detail page
   **Then** the displayed date should be 2025-09-15 (actual publication date)

2. **Given** a paper abstract contains URLs like "https://project-website.com" and "https://github.com/user/repo"
   **When** user views the paper abstract
   **Then** URLs should be clickable hyperlinks, visually distinguished from plain text

#### Scenario 2: Voting on Papers
3. **Given** a user viewing a paper detail page
   **When** user clicks the upvote button
   **Then** vote count increases by 1 and upvote button shows active state

4. **Given** a user has already upvoted a paper
   **When** user clicks the upvote button again
   **Then** upvote is removed and vote count decreases by 1

5. **Given** a user has upvoted a paper
   **When** user clicks the downvote button
   **Then** upvote is removed, downvote is applied, vote count changes by -2

#### Scenario 3: Viewing Author Information
6. **Given** a paper with multiple authors
   **When** user clicks on an author name in the paper list
   **Then** author detail modal/popup shows with affiliation, citation count, paper count, and contact info

7. **Given** viewing a paper detail page
   **When** page loads
   **Then** author cards display with affiliation information for each author

#### Scenario 4: Understanding Paper Content
8. **Given** a paper detail page loads
   **When** user scrolls down
   **Then** user sees Quick Summary, Key Ideas, Performance Metrics, and Limitations sections

9. **Given** a paper's performance section is populated
   **When** user views the section
   **Then** both quantitative metrics (numbers) and qualitative results (text) are clearly separated

#### Scenario 5: Tracking Paper Metrics
10. **Given** a paper has been tracked for 30 days
    **When** user views the paper detail page
    **Then** time-series graphs show daily trends for citations, GitHub stars, votes, and hype score

11. **Given** viewing a metric graph
    **When** user hovers over a data point
    **Then** tooltip shows exact date and value

#### Scenario 6: Starting Citation Network Crawl
12. **Given** user is on a paper detail page
    **When** user clicks "Start Crawling from This Paper" button
    **Then** user is navigated to crawler page with citation network mode pre-selected and paper ID pre-filled

### Edge Cases

#### Publication Date Issues
- What happens when arXiv paper has multiple version dates?
  ‚Üí **CLARIFIED**: Use the latest version date
- How to handle papers with no publication date in source data?
  ‚Üí Display crawl date with clear label "Added to database: [date]"

#### URL Detection in Abstracts
- What if abstract contains malformed or partial URLs?
  ‚Üí Only hyperlink valid, complete URLs (http:// or https://)
- How to handle very long URLs that break layout?
  ‚Üí **CLARIFIED**: URLs are not expected to be excessively long, no truncation needed

#### Voting System
- Can users vote without authentication?
  ‚Üí **CLARIFIED**: Users must be logged in to vote
- What prevents vote manipulation (one user voting many times)?
  ‚Üí **CLARIFIED**: Authentication-based - one vote per logged-in user account
- Can users change their vote from upvote to downvote?
  ‚Üí Yes, as per Scenario 5 above
- What is the initial vote count for newly added papers?
  ‚Üí Starts at 0

#### Author Information
- What if author has no affiliation data?
  ‚Üí Display "Affiliation not available"
- How to handle duplicate author names?
  ‚Üí **CLARIFIED**: Use name + affiliation combination to distinguish authors with identical names
- What if email/website not available?
  ‚Üí Display only available fields, hide missing ones

#### Metric Tracking
- When does daily metric snapshot get recorded?
  ‚Üí System should record one snapshot per day per metric per paper
- What if paper has no GitHub repo for star tracking?
  ‚Üí Graph shows only citation and vote metrics
- How long to retain historical metric data?
  ‚Üí Retain all historical data (no automatic deletion)

#### Hype Score Calculation
- If vote is negative, can hype score go negative?
  ‚Üí Hype score minimum should be 0
- What weight should votes have relative to citations and stars?
  ‚Üí **CLARIFIED**: Formula design with minimal vote impact:
    - Votes are unbounded and non-normalized
    - Use logarithmic scaling to dampen vote impact: vote_component = log(1 + max(0, votes)) * 5
    - This gives: 0 votes ‚Üí 0 points, 10 votes ‚Üí ~5.4 points, 100 votes ‚Üí ~10.1 points
    - Hype Score = (citation_growth * 0.35) + (star_growth * 0.35) + (absolute_metrics * 0.20) + (vote_component * 0.10)
    - Maximum contribution from votes is ~10-15% even with very high vote counts
